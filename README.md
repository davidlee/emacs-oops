## philosophy

- UX designed to minimise friction for power users
- Maximise expressive power through careful choice and combination of simple
components
- Local JSON storage to allow easy cross-device sync
- Aggressive separation of concerns. CLI, TUI, web front ends. Support for multiple datastore adapters.
- Be fast.
- Be simple.
- Everything is an entry
- Nondestructive / event-oriented data
- Plugin system: users can extend with JS / TS; user definitions are as powerful as built ins
